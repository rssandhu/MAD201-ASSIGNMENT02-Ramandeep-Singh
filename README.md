## Description

This Flutter project is a Personal Expense Tracker app that allows users to add, view, and manage their daily expenses. Users can:
- Add new expenses with a title, amount, description, and date.
- View all expenses in a scrollable list on the Home Screen.
- Tap an expense to see detailed information on a separate screen.

The app demonstrates stateful widget management with `setState()`, user input handling with `TextEditingController`, form validation, and multi-screen navigation using the `Navigator` class. The UI is built with Flutter’s modern widget and layout principles, and the codebase is organized with clear separation between models, screens, and reusable widgets. Professional GitHub workflow is followed including meaningful commits and pull requests.

## Features

- Multi-screen navigation: Home, Add Expense, Expense Details
- In-memory data storage using stateful widgets
- Input validation and clean error handling
- Simple, intuitive UI
- Structured documentation and maintainable codebase
